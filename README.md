A multiplayer battle game where you must take out the players by swinging various exotic animals. You can pick up different animals throughout the stage, which all have different benefits and physics.

The websockets server uses node.js, and is incredibly similar to Snoverchill's. clientScene.js attempts to connect to a server that is up occasionally, though you can change that yourself and host elsewhere.

## Bot

I made a bot for this game so that you can play it without other players. You still need the server connection, currently. You can find it at bot/, and it must be run separately from the game.
